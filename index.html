            <p>This program is written by <span style="font-weight: 800;">Ghazal Rabiei</span>.</p>
            <p>It uses only <span style="font-weight: 800;">pure</span> html, css and javaScript.</p>
            <p>The space used for drawing shapes is the default <span style="font-weight: 800;">canvas</span> (a html tag provided for drawing shapes and defining coordinates).</p>
            <p>The user can select 3 arbitrary points on the canvas. When the user selects each point, a circle is drawn using the coordinates of where was clicked.</p>
            <p>The 3 points clicked by the user are added to an array in the same order as they are clicked.</p>
            <p>When the user completes the selection of 3 points, the canvas shows a parallelogram that has these points as its 3 corners.</p>
            <p>The process of creating this parallelogram is such that we should find <span style="font-weight: 800;">the 4th point</span> of the parallelogram. With these 3 points, we have 2 sides of the parallelogram (the side that passes through point 1 and point 2 and the side that passes through point 3 and point 4).</p>
            <p>To find the 4th point, we can find <span style="font-weight: 800;">the line equations</span> of the other 2 sides and calculate <span style="font-weight: 800;">their intersection</span> and consider it as the point 4. Then we draw lines between these 4 points to see the parallelogram completely. There are some <span style="font-weight: 800;">special cases</span> that we should consider as well, that causes <span style="font-weight: 800;">infinite slopes</span> for sides.</p>
            <p>After finding the parallelogram, we should calculate its area. Calculating the area needs the size of <span style="font-weight: 800;">the height</span> and <span style="font-weight: 800;">the base</span>. With 3 points of the parallelogram, we can calculate the area. The side that has point 3 and 4 can be considered as the base and the line that passes through point 1 and perpendicular to the base can be considered as the height and then we can calculate their sizes.</p>
            <p>With the base and height, we can calculate the area of the parallelogram <span style="font-weight: 800;">(base * height)</span> which should be equal to the area of the circle we want to draw next.</p>
            <p>With the area of the circle, we can easily find its radius. The center of the circle is <span style="font-weight: 800;">the intersection of the diameters</span> of the parallelogram (because this point is the center of mass of the parallelogram) and we can draw the circle based on its radius and the coordinates of the center.</p>
            <p>To be able to move points, we can find the clicked corner of the parallelogram based on <span style="font-weight: 800;">the coordinates</span> of where the user is clicked. If the coordinates is <span style="font-weight: 800;">inside the area of any points</span>, we can clear the circle of that corner and draw its circle wherever <span style="font-weight: 800;">the mouse is pointed</span>. So, it seems like we <span style="font-weight: 800;">drag</span> the point to elsewhere. while dragging, we update the information (the coordinates the new point, the shape and area of the parallelogram and the shape of the circle).</p>
            <p>The user can reset the canvas by clicking on the <span style="font-weight: 800;">reset</span> button, that <span style="font-weight: 800;">clears</span> the array of the points so that the user can draw the points again.</p>
